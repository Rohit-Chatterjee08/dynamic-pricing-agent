# Run pending migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Verify migration status
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Backup Before Migration

```bash
# Create database backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Or use your cloud provider's backup tool
```

## üè™ Shopify Partner Dashboard Configuration

### 1. App URLs

| Setting | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **App URL** | `https://your-app.com/` |
| **Allowed redirection URL(s)** | `https://your-app.com/auth/callback` |

### 2. Webhook Configuration

| Topic | URL |
|-------|-----|
| **App uninstalled** | `https://your-app.com/webhooks/app/uninstalled` |
| **Customers data request** | `https://your-app.com/webhooks/customers/data_request` |

| **URL** | `https://your-app.com/proxy` |

## üîí Security Configuration

### SSL/TLS Certificate

Most hosting platforms (Render, Railway, Vercel) provide automatic HTTPS certificates. Ensure your app is only accessible via HTTPS in production.

### Content Security Policy

The app includes production-ready CSP headers that allow embedding in Shopify admin while maintaining security.

### Rate Limiting

Default rate limiting is set to 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP. Adjust in `lib/security.server.ts` if needed.

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Check Endpoint

Your app includes a health check endpoint at `/healthz` that verifies:

- Database connectivity
- Redis connectivity  
- Basic app functionality

### Log Monitoring

Structured JSON logs are output to stdout. Set up log aggregation with:

- **Render**: Logs available in dashboard
- **Railway**: Built-in logging
- **Vercel**: Vercel Analytics
- **External**: Datadog, New Relic, LogDNA

### Webhook Monitoring

Monitor webhook delivery status in your database:

```sql
-- Check failed webhook deliveries
SELECT topic, shop, status, error_message, created_at 
FROM webhook_deliveries 
WHERE status = 'FAILED' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check webhook processing times
SELECT topic, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (processed_at - created_at)) * 1000) as avg_processing_time_ms
FROM webhook_deliveries 
WHERE status = 'SUCCESS' 
GROUP BY topic;
```

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Automated Checks

Run the verification script after deployment:

```bash
# Run verification script
npm run verify-deployment
```
